## Accessibility Needs
We talked about different time zones and what works best for us as a team. We agreed to meet after class at around 3-4pm PTZ if needed. Otherwise, we plan to work during designated class hours and communicate through messages on Slack. 

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
We agreed to go through push pull commands on GitHub together during our class time so that we could see how the process is working and help each other if needed. 

## Learning Style
It is helpful to be vocal about our changes and talk through them directly to each other. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
Vivian is very flexible about getting feedback and sees it an opportunity to grow. Olga comppletely agrees and sees this as an opprtunity to learn too. Any feedback is welcome. 
## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
We both wantsto focus on problem-solving and communicating it with each other.
